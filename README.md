## Description

This is a command line application that allows you to manage a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.  With this application you are able to view all departments, roles, and employees. Additionally you can add a new department, role, or employee to the database, or update and employee role aswell. This project really helped me understand how SQL works and how to interact with a database. It also introduced me to working with asynchronus functions as some of the add and update functions needed to be async.
